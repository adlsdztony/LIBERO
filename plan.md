  ⎿ LIBERO-GenSim2 Integration Project: Current Status & Next Steps

    🎯 Project Goal

    Integrate GenSim2's keypoint-based motion planning with LIBERO environments to collect trajectory data 
    for robot policy training using semantic keypoints on objects.

    ✅ What's Been Accomplished

    1. Asset Structure Analysis: Compared LIBERO vs GenSim2 object organization
    2. Keypoint Selection Tool Created: Successfully built libero_select_keypoint.py that works with LIBERO
     static objects
    3. Testing Completed: Verified 100% success on 5 LIBERO static objects (bowls, plates, baskets, etc.)
    4. Visualization Tool: Created libero_vis_keypoint.py for viewing keypoints on objects

    ❌ Current Blocking Issue

    LIBERO articulated objects (drawers, cabinets, appliances) cannot be processed because:
    - LIBERO uses .msh mesh files that trimesh library cannot read
    - GenSim2 uses .obj files that work perfectly with trimesh
    - Our keypoint selection tool fails on articulated objects like white_cabinet.xml

    📊 Problem Details

    LIBERO Articulated Structure (❌ Broken):

    white_cabinet.xml → references white_cabinet/*/visual/*.msh files
    ├── white_cabinet_base/visual/white_cabinet_base_vis.msh ❌ (trimesh can't read)
    ├── white_cabinet_top/visual/white_cabinet_top_vis.msh ❌ 
    └── white_cabinet_handle/visual/white_cabinet_handle_vis.msh ❌

    GenSim2 Articulated Structure (✅ Working):

    mobility.urdf → references textured_objs/*.obj files  
    ├── textured_objs/original-1.obj ✅ (trimesh can read)
    ├── textured_objs/original-10.obj ✅
    └── textured_objs/original-11.obj ✅

    🛠️ Immediate Next Steps

    Priority 1: Solve .msh File Reading

    1. Research MuJoCo .msh Format: 
      - Examine actual .msh file structure (binary/text?)
      - Find specification or reverse-engineer format
      - Look for existing parsers in MuJoCo codebase
    2. Three Potential Solutions:
      - Option A: Create .msh reader for trimesh
      - Option B: Convert .msh to .obj files in LIBERO
      - Option C: Use alternative mesh loading approach
    3. Test Solution: Verify articulated objects load correctly

    Priority 2: Complete Integration

    4. Extend Keypoint Selection: Support multi-part articulated objects
    5. Add Joint Awareness: Handle moving parts and transformations  
    6. Bridge to GenSim2: Create LIBERO-GenSim2 object interface
    7. Motion Planning Integration: Connect keypoints to KPAM solver
    8. Data Collection Pipeline: Automated trajectory generation

    🎯 Success Criteria

    - ✅ Static LIBERO objects support keypoints (DONE)
    - ❌ Articulated LIBERO objects support keypoints (BLOCKED)
    - ⏳ Motion planning works in LIBERO environments
    - ⏳ Trajectory data collection system operational

    🚨 Immediate Action Required

    Must solve .msh file reading to proceed with articulated objects - this is the critical blocker 
    preventing full LIBERO integration with GenSim2's motion planning capabilities.
